                <p>
                I am a full-stack developer, creative technologist and recent graduate from Enspiral Dev Academy - an intensive full-stack programming bootcamp that incorporates soft skills and key agile principles and practices into the learning curriculum.
                </p>
                <p>
                I also bring knowledge and experience from my roots as small business owner and filmmaker and I am excited to have the opportunity to combine my technical skills and knowledge with my creative background to collaborate on meaningful projects as a part of a team!  
                </p>
